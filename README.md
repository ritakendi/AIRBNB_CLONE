# AirBnB Clone
This will be the overarching final project that is aimed at learning fundamental concepts of higher level programming and web application development processes..
We will be deploying a simple copy of the AirBnB website. This will evolve through four critical components:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

# Overview
The project will grow through several steps:
- The console: Where we'll create our data model, manage objects via console, store and persist objects to a JSON file.
- Web static: Where we will learn HTML/CSS, create the HTML of the application, create a template for each object.
- MySQL storage: Where we'll replace the file storage by a DB storage, map our models to a table in DB using an ORM
- Web framework - templating: Where we'll create our first web server in Python, make static HTML file dynamic using objects stored in a file or DB
- RESTful API: Where we'll expose all our objects stored via JSON web interface, manipulate our objects via a RESTful API
- Web dynamic: Where we'll learn JQuery, load objects from client-side using our own RESTful API

# Files and Directories
---------------------
# Models
This directory contains all classes used for the entire project. The class will be a representation of the object/instance in OOP.

- base_model.py: This file is the base class of all our models.
- engine: This directory will contain all storage classes. 

# Tests
This directory contains all unit tests.

# Console.py
This file is the entry point of our command interpreter.


# The command interpreter
---------------------------
# How to start
The code for the command interpreter is in console.py.

To start the console, type ./console.py or python3 console.py in the directory console.py is in. This will make the command prompt (hbnb) appear on your terminal.
# How to use
The console accepts the following commands: EOF (CTRL+D), quit, create, show, destroy, all, and update.

Command completion and command history are supported.

Entering <TAB> will autocomplete or show you the options for autocompletion.

# EOF and Quit
Typing CTRL+D or quit into the console will exit the console.

# Examples
```
